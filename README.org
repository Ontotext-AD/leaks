** Offshore Links
The [[https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/][Offshore Leaks]] database of The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)
is a wonderful resource that allows you to explore the murky world of high-flyer finance and offshore destinations.
It includes two sources:
- [[https://panamapapers.icij.org][Panama Papers]]
- [[https://www.icij.org/offshore][Offshore Leaks]] (but seemingly excluding Luxembourg Leaks, see sec [[*Offshore Jurisdictions]])

[[https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database][The database]] was released on May 10 (please download it from their torrent link)
and on May 12 we decided to explore it using Linked Open Data (LOD).

** The Database
The database is available as 5 CSV files with the following number of records:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>wc -l *.csv
   151128 Addresses.csv
   319422 Entities.csv
    23643 Intermediaries.csv
   345646 Officers.csv
  1269797 all_edges.csv
#+END_EXAMPLE
When parsing it, you should be careful about two aspects:
- CSV quoting
- Unicode (UTF-8) encoding

The files have the following columns, which you can see with
: head -1 *.csv
As we analyze the data, we'll add more in-depth notes.

* RDF Conversion

** Date Conversion
The dates in ~Entities.csv~ have the form "06-NOV-2009", but we want to convert them to proper xsd:date, eg "2009-11-06".
We do that with a script [[./dates.pl]] by calling it like
: perl dates.pl Entities.csv > Entities-dated.csv

We can find the distribution of years like this:
: perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if m{\b[0-9]{2}-[A-Z]{3}-([0-9]{4})\b}' Entities.csv|sort|uniq -c
The most active years were 1999-2009. (There are also 9 invalid dates 1-APR-1001.)

** Leaks Ontology
First we define all prefixes we use in a single file [[./prefixes.ttl]], so we won't have to repeat them many times.
In addition to standard prefixes (that you can get from http://prefix.cc/dbr,dbo,dct,rdf,rdfs,skos,owl,xsd.ttl),
we also define:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
@prefix leak:  <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leak/>.   # ontology
@prefix leaks: <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leaks/> . # data
#+END_SRC

We made an ontology [[./leak-ontology.ttl]]. It has these parts:
- The prefixes described above
- A header that describes the ontology itself:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak: a owl:Ontology;
  rdfs:label "Offshore Leaks ontology";
  rdfs:comment "Describes the ICIJ Offshore Leaks database released on 2016-05-10";
  dct:subject dbr:Offshore_company, dbr:Money_laundering, dbr:Tax_evasion;
  dct:created "2016-05-12"^^xsd:date;
  rdfs:seeAlso
    <https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/>,
    <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leaks>,
    <https://github.com/Ontotext-AD/leaks>;
  dct:source <https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database>;
  dct:creator <http://www.ontotext.com>;
  void:sparqlEndpoint <http://data.ontotext.com/sparql>.
#+END_SRC
- "Raw" classes and data properties derived directly from the CSVs, eg:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak:Node a owl:Class;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy leak:;
  rdfs:label "Node";
  rdfs:comment "Any kind of node".

leak:Address a owl:Class;
  rdfs:subClassOf leak:Node;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy leak:;
  rdfs:label "Address";
  rdfs:comment "Address of an entity, intermediary or officer".

leak:address a owl:DatatypeProperty;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy leak:;
  rdfs:label "address";
  rdfs:domain leak:Node;
  rdfs:comment "Textual address".
#+END_SRC
- Explicit linking and structuring object properties, eg
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak:hasCountry a owl:ObjectProperty;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy leak:;
  rdfs:label "hasCountry";
  rdfs:domain leak:Node;
  rdfs:range leak:Country;
  rdfs:comment "Country (Countries) of Address, Entity, Intermediary or Officer";
  skos:scopeNote "Obtained by splitting country_codes on ';' and linking".

leak:hasJurisdiction a owl:ObjectProperty;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy leak:;
  rdfs:label "hasJurisdiction";
  rdfs:domain leak:Entity;
  rdfs:range leak:OffshoreJurisdiction;
  rdfs:comment "OffshoreJurisdiction of an Entity".
#+END_SRC
- interpretation object properties, not explicitly present in the CSV files
  They are meant to layer further structure based on
  implicit semantics and inferencing (property generalization)

We make it by concatenating these parts:
: cat prefixes.ttl leak.ttl leak-inferred.ttl > leak-ontology.ttl

** tarql
We use [[https://github.com/tarql/tarql][tarql]] (SPARQL processor for Tables) to convert from CSV to Turtle.

*** tarql Queries
~tarql~ is driven by CONSTRUCT queries.
They are fairly straight-forward: the columns are mapped to raw data properties of the same name,
while the URL is made of a descriptive prefix (eg "address-") and the ~node_id~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
prefix rdf:   <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
prefix leak:  <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leaks#> # ontology
prefix leaks: <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leaks/> # data

construct {
  ?node a leak:Address;
    leak:address        ?address;
    leak:icij_id        ?icij_id;
    leak:valid_until    ?valid_until;
    leak:country_codes  ?country_codes;
    leak:countries      ?countries;
    leak:node_id        ?node_id;
    leak:sourceID       ?sourceID
  }
from <file:../Addresses.csv#encoding=utf-8>
where {
  bind(uri(concat(str(leaks:),"address-",?node_id)) as ?node)
}
#+END_SRC
We got [[./addresses.rq]], [[./edges.rq]], [[./entities.rq]], [[./intermediaries.rq]], [[./officers.rq]].
(These are the only files that include prefixes, since ~tarql~ can't use an extra prefix file.)

*** tarql Results
The  [[./addresses.rq]] query produces Turtle RDF data like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:address-14000003
        rdf:type            leak:Address ;
        leak:address        "\"Cantonia\" South Road St Georges Hill Weybridge, Surrey" ;
        leak:icij_id        "240EE44DFB70AF775E6CD02AF8CB889B" ;
        leak:valid_until    "The Panama Papers  data is current through 2015" ;
        leak:country_codes  "GBR" ;
        leak:countries      "United Kingdom" ;
        leak:node_id        "14000003" ;
        leak:sourceID       "Panama Papers" .
#+END_SRC
The other files are similar. Only edges are a bit different: they use UUIDs, because
- the same pair <node_1, node_2> may be connected by several edges,
- yet edges don't have a unique ID themselves, and ~tarql~'s special variable ~?ROWNUM~ doesn't work:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:edge-31203a84-a56e-4e2a-8bc6-0921a399b691
        rdf:type       leak:Edge ;
        leak:node_1    "11000001" ;
        leak:rel_type  "intermediary of" ;
        leak:node_2    "10208879" .

#+END_SRC

Unicode is handled properly by ~tarql~, eg:
- Côte d'Ivoire, Curaçao
- ELÍAS BAYTER MONTENEGRO, MARITZA GARCIA ALCÁNTARA
- etc

*** Running tarql
Since the queries designate the input files (assumed to be in a directory one level up), we run ~tarql~ simply like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
tarql addresses.rq      > addresses.ttl
tarql edges.rq          > edges.ttl
tarql entities.rq       > entities.ttl
tarql intermediaries.rq > intermediaries.ttl
tarql officers.rq       > officers.ttl
#+END_EXAMPLE

This easily makes 760Mb of RDF data, so you better have a fast disk (SSD). Voila!

~tarql~ skips some rows (unexplained), but the loss is very small.
Eg 319150 entities.ttl vs 319421 Entities.csv, or a loss of 0.08%

** Country Codes
Since the data uses ISO alpha3 country codes, we have to use that to correlate to DBpedia.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1][Wikipedia]] has such a list in the form of a table
- [[http://www.geonames.org/countries/][Geonames]] has another such list
- We extracted them to a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zjp_azlkZzczkQvi2mnY68AscfwBHIsFjw6HjZFSV2U/edit][Google sheet]] and did a quick check that all codes match (Geonames has 3 more)
The Google sheet almost does what we want, but the first column is a country display name, and not the actual page title
- Aland Islands !Åland Islands: the first is used for sorting, and the second is the page title
- Virgin Islands (British) is the display name, but British Virgin Islands is the actual page title

So we wrote a script [[./countries-wiki.pl]] that extracts country links from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title%3DISO_3166-1&action%3Dedit&section%3D5][Wikipedia source]] ([[./countries-wiki-source.txt]]).
The result [[./countries-wiki.txt]] looks like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ABW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aruba
AFG	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan
...
XXX	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Undefined
#+END_EXAMPLE
The data uses code "XXX" Undefined, so we've added a fake line for it (~dbr:Undefined~ is a disambiguation page, but is good enough to use as a signal value).

It turns out that ~Addresses.csv~ has the largest number of country codes (211).
We cross-checked, and all codes are covered by Wikipedia (250) and Geonames (252).

We got [[./countries-dbpedia.ttl]] (211) with statements like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak:country-ABW a leak:Country; leak:code "ABW"; leak:name "Aruba";  owl:sameAs dbr:Aruba.
leak:country-AGO a leak:Country; leak:code "AGO"; leak:name "Angola"; owl:sameAs dbr:Angola.
...
#+END_SRC

We also split [[./countries-noleak.ttl]] (49) with countries that don't appear as leak:Country (but may appear as leak:OffshoreJurisdiction).
It only has coreference to DBpedia that may be useful in the future, eg:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak:country-AFG owl:sameAs dbr:Afghanistan.
leak:country-ALA owl:sameAs dbr:Åland_Islands.
#+END_SRC

** Offshore Jurisdictions
[[./jurisdictions.ttl]] includes data about the Offshore Jurisdictions
- The bigest destination in the Panama Leaks is BVI, but many remain XXX "Undetermined":
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:offshore-BVI    a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "BVI";   leak:name "British Virgin Islands";   skos:exactMatch dbr:British_Virgin_Islands . # 151588
leaks:offshore-XXX    a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "XXX";   leak:name "Undetermined";             skos:exactMatch dbr:Undetermined           . # 55645
#+END_SRC
- Many of them re tiny islands and other exotic locations:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:offshore-NIUE   a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "NIUE";  leak:name "Niue";                     skos:exactMatch dbr:Niue                   . # 9611
leaks:offshore-LABUA  a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "LABUA"; leak:name "Labuan";                   skos:exactMatch dbr:Labuan                 . # 421
#+END_SRC
- Some are not countries but parts thereof (eg a US state and a UAE emirate):
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:offshore-WYO    a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "WYO";   leak:name "Wyoming";                  skos:exactMatch dbr:Wyoming                . # 37
leaks:offshore-RAK    a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "RAK";   leak:name "Ras Al Khaimah";           skos:exactMatch dbr:Ras_al-Khaimah         . # 2
#+END_SRC
Notably, Luxembourg is missing from the list (see [[https://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks][Luxembourg Leaks]])

** Data Model
To enrich and use the RDF data efficiently, it's important to understand how it is laid out, i.e. the data model
(or as is currently called, [[https://www.w3.org/2014/data-shapes][RDF Shape]]).

Ontotext has developed a tool *rdfpuml* that creates precise diagrams from actual Turtle.
See "Making True RDF Diagrams With rdfpuml": [[http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/pres/20160325-rdfpuml/][presentation]] or [[http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/pres/20160325-rdfpuml/index-full.html][continuous HTML]].

We made a sample [[./model.ttl]] that describes a few entities, Edges between them, and the associated Countries and Offshore jurisdictions.
We generated the following diagram directly from it:
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
This currently works only on Vlado's
: perl -S rdfpuml.pl model.ttl ; puml.bat model.puml
#+END_COMMENT

[[./model.png]]

We'll keep enriching the diagram as we add more inferences. Stay tuned.

** Day1 Recap
#+BEGIN_COMMENT

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:@pple/List_of_archaic_English_words_and_their_modern_equivalents
#+END_COMMENT

And looked Onto upon the land, and saw that it was good:
- CSVs parsed good, the devilish comma betwixt data divined right
- UTFs looketh right
- tarql worketh fastly and loseth nearly nought data (0.08%)
- 760 million ducats of RDF spilt forth
- Prefixes unified and registered as http://prefix.cc/leak
- Ontology described by the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/void/][VOID]], and shalt be registered in the [[http://lov.okfn.org/][LOV]] (see [[https://plus.google.com/115593825497938381443/posts/7SaKJW3sanm][LOV announcement]])
- Data model lucid and clear
- Countries and Offshores hast connexion to DBpedia

And there was evening (actually well past midnight), and there was morning--the first day.

* Inferencing
Day 2: <2016-05-13 Fri>
What shall we do today? How about inferring some new data from the basic RDF.

** Linking Countries and Offshore Jurisdictions
In the original data, countries and jurisdictions are represented with codes
(eg "AUS;BLZ" for 2 countries and "CAYMN" for 1 offshore destination).
It's easier to query the data if these are made into explicit links,
especially if one wants to explore hierarchical links (eg Entities active in Eastern Europe countries).

So we created UPDATE queries [[./countries-link.ru]], [[./jurisdictions-link.ru]]
to make links ~hasCountry~ and ~hasJurisdiction~ respectively.
The first query is more complex since there can be several codes in ~country_codes~ (separated with ~;~):
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
insert {
  graph leaks:countries-link {
    ?node leak:hasCountry ?country
  }
} where {
  ?node leak:country_codes ?codes.
  ?country a leak:Country; leak:countryCode ?code.
  filter(contains(?codes,?code))
}
#+END_SRC

** Linking Entities
The INSERT query [[./edges-link.ru]] makes explicit connections ~hasSource~ and ~hasTarget~ for every ~Edge~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
insert {
    graph leaks:edges-link {
      ?edge leak:hasSource ?src; leak:hasTarget ?trg
    }
} where {
  ?edge leak:node_1 ?src_id;
        leak:node_2 ?trg_id.
  ?src leak:node_id ?src_id.
  ?trg leak:node_id ?trg_id.
}
#+END_SRC

We also made another INSERT query [[./edges-specific.ru]] that converts
the ~rel_type~ literals listed in sec [[*rel_type]] into similarly-named relations:
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
insert {
  graph leaks:specific-relations {
    ?src ?rel ?trg
  }
} where {
  values (?rel_type ?rel) {
    ("Alternate Director of"  leak:isAlternateDirectorOf)
    ("Appointor of"           leak:isAppointorOf)
    ("Assistant Secretary of" leak:isAssistantSecretaryOf)
    ...
  }
  ?edge leak:hasSource ?src;
        leak:hasTarget ?trg;
        leak:rel_type  ?rel_type .
}
#+END_SRC

** Relation Hierarchy
The raw ~rel_types~ mentioned in the previous section are hard to understand or query:
- There are a lot of them (84)
- Some are very similar, eg "Shareholder (through Julex Foundation) of" and "Shareholder of"
- Some combine several roles in one raw relation, eg "Director / Shareholder / Beneficial Owner of"
We have therefore created a hierarchy of properties in [[./leak-ontology.ttl]] 
that group similar relations into groups, allowing easier querying.

Raw relations are in camelCase and inferred ("cooked") relations are in UPPERCASE.
The hierarchy goes something like this, and is subject to change.
~...~ indicates there are more raw relations that are skipped for brevity:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE  
hasRegisteredAddress
isIntermediaryOf
RELATED
  relatedEntity
  similarNameAndAddressAs ...
  SAME
    sameNameAndRegistrationDateAs
RELATED_AGENT
  OWNER
    isBeneficialOwnerOf
    isNomineeBeneficialOwnerOf
    isBeneficiaryShareholderAndDirectorOf (1) ...
    REAL_OWNER (3)
  AGENT_OF
    OFFICER
      isOfficerOf
      EXECUTIVE
        isPresidentOf
        isVicePresidentOf
        isPresidentAndDirectorOf
        isTrusteeOfTrustOf
        isCo-TrusteeOfTrustOf ...
    SERVICE_PROVIDER
      isAppointorOf
      isAuditorOf
      isSecretaryOf
      isGranteeOfAMortgageOf
      AUTHORIZED_REPRESENTATIVE
        isAuthRepresentativeOf
        isAuthorisedPersonSignatoryOf
        isBankSignatoryOf ...
    DIRECTOR
      isDirectorOf
      isBeneficiaryShareholderAndDirectorOf (1)
      isDirectorAndShareholderOf
      isMemberOfFoundationCouncilOf
      isNomineeDirectorOf (2) ...
    NOMINEE
      isNominatedPersonOf
      isNomineeDirectorOf
      isNomineeBeneficialOwnerOf (2) ...
#+END_EXAMPLE
Notes:
1. Combined raw relations (eg isDirectorShareholderBeneficialOwnerOf) 
   appear in several branches, thus contributing to several cooked relations 
   (eg in this case  DIRECTOR, OWNER)
2. NOMINEE is a sort of flag, eg a DIRECTOR can be a real director, or NOMINEE director
3. Although we distinguish REAL_OWNER as a sub-prop of OWNER,
   we don't yet have any instances of it.
   Indeed the essence of investigative work is to find out the real owner.

** Geonames Place Hierarchy
We want to correlate countries to Geonames (in addition to DBpedia), in order to:
use the ~gn:parentFeature~ hierarchy to group countries 
by region (eg Eastern Europe) and continent (eg Europe).

We use the Ontotext endpoint [[http://ff-news.ontotext.com/sparql]] that has
DBpedia and Geonames integrated with owl:sameAs statements between these datasets.
The following query returns the places (~gn:Feature~) above country (~gn:A.PCLI~):
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
PREFIX gn: <http://www.geonames.org/ontology#>
PREFIX onto: <http://www.ontotext.com/>
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

We filter ~gn:A.PCLI~ itself, because there are some mistakes (eg ~dbr:Barbados~ is parent of itself).

The result is as follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dbr:Africa

dbr:Asia
dbr:Australia_and_New_Zealand

#+END_EXAMPLE
- Mahgreb is a region of Northwest Africa that includes: Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia
- W_National_Park is a major trans-national park in West Africa that includes areas of: Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso
- La_Habana_Province is a mistake in Geonames: the small village America in that province
  is made parent of South_America and North_America: we've replaced it with ~dbr:Americas~

** Geonames Data
We use the following query [[./geonames-top-level.rq]] to extract places at the level of country or above,
and the following attributes (~geonames-top-level.ttl~):
- URL in the dbr: namespace, eg dbr:Europe
- gn:name: official name
- dbo:abstract: description
- gn:featureCode: place type(s), eg A.PCLI (independent country), L.CONT (continent), L.RGN (region)
- gn:parentFeature: ancestor places
- wgs:lat, wgs:long: geographic coordinates
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
TODO geonames-top-level.rq
#+END_SRC

** Linking to Source
We make links back to the source (https://offshoreleaks.icij.org) 
in order to give credit where credit is due, 
and to allow easy inspection of the ICIJ interactive graphs ([[./seeAlso.ru]]):
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
insert {
  graph leaks:seeAlso {
    ?node rdfs:seeAlso ?icij_org
  }
} where {
  ?node leak:node_id ?node_id
  bind(iri(concat("https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/",?node_id)) as ?icij_org)
}
#+END_SRC

** Data Loading Stats
[[./leaks-load.xlsx]] includes some stats on loading the data and inferencing.
Here is a screen shot, but it's not updated:

** Day2 Recap
Brushed Onto the sweat from its weary brow, and looketh at the fruit of its day's work:
- Relations between Nodes made
- Relations of entities grouped in an interpretive hierarchy
- Links back to the source (https://offshoreleaks.icij.org) added
- Hierarchy above countries obtained from Geonames

A Leaks dataset is borne.
Go forth and queriest! 
Whence did money came from, and whither did it flow?

And there was evening, and there was morning--the second day.

* TODO Further Ideas
This is a parking place for stuff to do in the future:
- Network analysis
- leak:Officer including the word "BEARER" (and variations) should be marked specially as "bearer shares".
  These are essentially anonymous shareholders or beneficiaries, often used for money laundering.
  Most countries have banned registration of Entities with bearer shares
- Addresses: there are literals ~Entity.address~ and ~Intermediary.address~,
  and also link ~hasRegisteredAddress~ to the separate class ~Address~, which has literal ~Address.address~.
  What nodes have ~hasRegisteredAddress~? What is the relation between these
- Look for Entities in the FIBO LEI database?
