** Offshore Links
The [[https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/][Offshore Leaks]] database of The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ)
is a wonderful resource that allows you to explore the murky world of high-flyer finance and offshore destinations.
It includes two sources:
- [[https://panamapapers.icij.org][Panama Papers]]
- [[https://www.icij.org/offshore][Offshore Leaks]] (but seemingly excluding Luxembourg Leaks, see sec [[* Offshore Jurisdictions]])

[[https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database][The database]] was released on May 10 (please download it from their torrent link)
and on May 12 we decided to explore it using Linked Open Data (LOD).

** The Database
The database is available as 5 CSV files with the following number of records:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
>wc -l *.csv
   151128 Addresses.csv
   319422 Entities.csv
    23643 Intermediaries.csv
   345646 Officers.csv
  1269797 all_edges.csv
#+END_EXAMPLE
When parsing it, you should be careful about two aspects:
- CSV quoting
- Unicode (UTF-8) encoding

The files have the following columns, which you can see with
: head -1 *.csv
As we analyze the data, we'll add more in-depth notes.

* RDF Conversion

** Date Conversion
The dates in ~Entities.csv~ have the form "06-NOV-2009", but we want to convert them to proper xsd:date, eg "2009-11-06".
We do that with a script [[./dates.pl]] by calling it like
: perl dates.pl Entities.csv > Entities-dated.csv

We can find the distribution of years like this:
: perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if m{\b[0-9]{2}-[A-Z]{3}-([0-9]{4})\b}' Entities.csv|sort|uniq -c
The most active years were 1999-2009. (There are also 9 invalid dates 1-APR-1001.)

** Leaks Ontology
First we define all prefixes we use in a single file [[./prefixes.ttl]], so we won't have to repeat them many times.
In addition to standard prefixes (that you can get from http://prefix.cc/dbr,dbo,dct,rdf,rdfs,skos,owl,xsd.ttl),
we also define:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
@prefix leak:  <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leaks#>.  # ontology
@prefix leaks: <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leaks/> . # data
#+END_SRC

We made an ontology [[./leak.ttl]]. It has 4 parts:
- A header that describes the ontology itself:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak: a owl:Ontology;
  rdfs:label "Offshore Leaks ontology";
  rdfs:comment "Describes the ICIJ Offshore Leaks database released on 2016-05-10";
  dct:subject dbr:Offshore_company, dbr:Money_laundering, dbr:Tax_evasion;
  dct:created "2016-05-12"^^xsd:date;
  rdfs:seeAlso
    <https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/>,
    <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leaks>,
    <https://github.com/Ontotext-AD/leaks>;
  dct:source <https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/pages/database>;
  dct:creator <http://www.ontotext.com>;
  void:sparqlEndpoint <http://data.ontotext.com/sparql>.
#+END_SRC
- "raw" classes and properties derived directly from the CSVs, eg:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak:Node a owl:Class;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy leak:;
  rdfs:label "Node";
  rdfs:comment "Any kind of node".

leak:Address a owl:Class;
  rdfs:subClassOf leak:Node;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy leak:;
  rdfs:label "Address";
  rdfs:comment "Address of an entity, intermediary or officer".
#+END_SRC
- "Cooked" classes and properties, inferred from the raw data, eg (we'll be adding more):
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak:Country a owl:Class;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy leak:;
  rdfs:label "Country";
  rdfs:comment "Country identified by its ISO alpha3 code";
  skos:example "leaks:country-VGB, which is owl:sameAs dbr:British_Virgin_Islands".

leak:hasCountry a owl:ObjectProperty;
  rdfs:isDefinedBy leak:;
  rdfs:label "hasCountry";
  rdfs:domain leak:Node;
  rdfs:range leak:Country;
  rdfs:comment "Obtained by splitting country_codes on ';' and linking".
#+END_SRC

[[./leak-ontology.ttl]]: standalone version (prefixes prepended)
: cat prefixes.ttl leak.ttl > leak-ontology.ttl

** tarql
We use [[https://github.com/tarql/tarql][tarql]] (SPARQL processor for Tables) to convert from CSV to Turtle.

*** tarql Queries
~tarql~ is driven by CONSTRUCT queries.
They are fairly straight-forward: the columns are mapped to raw data properties of the same name,
while the URL is made of a descriptive prefix (eg "address-") and the ~node_id~:
#+BEGIN_SRC sparql
prefix rdf:   <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
prefix leak:  <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leaks#> # ontology
prefix leaks: <http://data.ontotext.com/resource/leaks/> # data

construct {
  ?node a leak:Address;
    leak:address        ?address;
    leak:icij_id        ?icij_id;
    leak:valid_until    ?valid_until;
    leak:country_codes  ?country_codes;
    leak:countries      ?countries;
    leak:node_id        ?node_id;
    leak:sourceID       ?sourceID
  }
from <file:../Addresses.csv#encoding=utf-8>
where {
  bind(uri(concat(str(leaks:),"address-",?node_id)) as ?node)
}
#+END_SRC
We got [[./addresses.rq]], [[./edges.rq]], [[./entities.rq]], [[./intermediaries.rq]], [[./officers.rq]].
(These are the only files that include prefixes, since ~tarql~ can't use an extra prefix file.)

*** tarql Results
The  [[./addresses.rq]] query produces Turtle RDF data like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:address-14000003
        rdf:type            leak:Address ;
        leak:address        "\"Cantonia\" South Road St Georges Hill Weybridge, Surrey" ;
        leak:icij_id        "240EE44DFB70AF775E6CD02AF8CB889B" ;
        leak:valid_until    "The Panama Papers  data is current through 2015" ;
        leak:country_codes  "GBR" ;
        leak:countries      "United Kingdom" ;
        leak:node_id        "14000003" ;
        leak:sourceID       "Panama Papers" .
#+END_SRC
The other files are similar. Only edges are a bit different: they use UUIDs, because 
- the same pair <node_1, node_2> may be connected by several edges,
- yet edges don't have a unique ID themselves, and ~tarql~'s special variable ~?ROWNUM~ doesn't work:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:edge-31203a84-a56e-4e2a-8bc6-0921a399b691
        rdf:type       leak:Edge ;
        leak:node_1    "11000001" ;
        leak:rel_type  "intermediary of" ;
        leak:node_2    "10208879" .

#+END_SRC

Unicode is handled properly by ~tarql~, eg:
- Côte d'Ivoire, Curaçao
- ELÍAS BAYTER MONTENEGRO, MARITZA GARCIA ALCÁNTARA
- etc

*** Running tarql
Since the queries designate the input files (assumed to be in a directory one level up), we run ~tarql~ simply like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
tarql addresses.rq      > addresses.ttl
tarql edges.rq          > edges.ttl
tarql entities.rq       > entities.ttl
tarql intermediaries.rq > intermediaries.ttl
tarql officers.rq       > officers.ttl
#+END_EXAMPLE

This easily makes 760Mb of RDF data, so you better have a fast disk (SSD). Voila!

~tarql~ skips some rows (unexplained), but the loss is very small.
Eg 319150 entities.ttl vs 319421 Entities.csv, or a loss of 0.08%

** TODO Geonames and DBpedia Geography
We want to correlate countries to Geonames and DBpedia, in order to use the ~gn:parentFeature~ hierarchy to group countries by region (eg Eastern Europe) and continent (eg Europe).

** Country Codes
Since the data uses ISO alpha3 country codes, we have to use that to correlate to DBpedia.
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1][Wikipedia]] has such a list in the form of a table
- [[http://www.geonames.org/countries/][Geonames]] has another such list
- We extracted them to a [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zjp_azlkZzczkQvi2mnY68AscfwBHIsFjw6HjZFSV2U/edit][Google sheet]] and did a quick check that all codes match (Geonames has 3 more)
The Google sheet almost does what we want, but the first column is a country display name, and not the actual page title
- Aland Islands !Åland Islands: the first is used for sorting, and the second is the page title
- Virgin Islands (British) is the display name, but British Virgin Islands is the actual page title

So we wrote a script [[./countries-wiki.pl]] that extracts country links from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title%3DISO_3166-1&action%3Dedit&section%3D5][Wikipedia source]] ([[./countries-wiki-source.txt]]).
The result [[./countries-wiki.txt]] looks like this:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ABW	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aruba
AFG	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afghanistan
...
XXX	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Undefined
#+END_EXAMPLE
The data uses code "XXX" Undefined, so we've added a fake line for it (~dbr:Undefined~ is a disambiguation page, but is good enough to use as a signal value).

It turns out that ~Addresses.csv~ has the largest number of country codes (211).
We cross-checked, and all codes are covered by Wikipedia (250) and Geonames (252).

We got [[./countries-dbpedia.ttl]] (211) with statements like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak:country-ABW a leak:Country; leak:code "ABW"; leak:name "Aruba";  owl:sameAs dbr:Aruba.
leak:country-AGO a leak:Country; leak:code "AGO"; leak:name "Angola"; owl:sameAs dbr:Angola.
...
#+END_SRC

We also split [[./countries-noleak.ttl]] (49) with countries that don't appear as leak:Country (but may appear as leak:OffshoreJurisdiction).
It only has coreference to DBpedia that may be useful in the future, eg:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leak:country-AFG owl:sameAs dbr:Afghanistan.
leak:country-ALA owl:sameAs dbr:Åland_Islands.
#+END_SRC

** Offshore Jurisdictions
[[./jurisdictions.ttl]] includes data about the Offshore Jurisdictions
- The bigest destination in the Panama Leaks is BVI, but many remain XXX "Undetermined":
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:offshore-BVI    a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "BVI";   leak:name "British Virgin Islands";   skos:exactMatch dbr:British_Virgin_Islands . # 151588
leaks:offshore-XXX    a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "XXX";   leak:name "Undetermined";             skos:exactMatch dbr:Undetermined           . # 55645
#+END_SRC
- Many of them re tiny islands and other exotic locations:
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:offshore-NIUE   a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "NIUE";  leak:name "Niue";                     skos:exactMatch dbr:Niue                   . # 9611
leaks:offshore-LABUA  a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "LABUA"; leak:name "Labuan";                   skos:exactMatch dbr:Labuan                 . # 421
#+END_SRC
- Some are not countries but parts thereof (eg a US state and a UAE emirate):
#+BEGIN_SRC Turtle
leaks:offshore-WYO    a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "WYO";   leak:name "Wyoming";                  skos:exactMatch dbr:Wyoming                . # 37
leaks:offshore-RAK    a leak:OffshoreJurisdiction; leak:code "RAK";   leak:name "Ras Al Khaimah";           skos:exactMatch dbr:Ras_al-Khaimah         . # 2
#+END_SRC
Notably, Luxembourg is missing from the list (see [[https://www.icij.org/project/luxembourg-leaks][Luxembourg Leaks]])

** Data Model
To enrich and use the RDF data efficiently, it's important to understand how it is laid out, i.e. the data model 
(or as is currently called, [[https://www.w3.org/2014/data-shapes][RDF Shape]]).

Ontotext has developed a tool *rdfpuml* that creates precise diagrams from actual Turtle.
See "Making True RDF Diagrams With rdfpuml": [[http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/pres/20160325-rdfpuml/][presentation]] or [[http://vladimiralexiev.github.io/pres/20160325-rdfpuml/index-full.html][continuous HTML]].

We made a sample [[./model.ttl]] that describes a few entities, Edges between them, and the associated Countries and Offshore jurisdictions.
We generated the following diagram directly from it:
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
This currently works only on Vlado's
: perl -S rdfpuml.pl model.ttl ; puml.bat model.puml
#+END_COMMENT

[[./model.png]]

We'll keep enriching the diagram as we add more inferences. Stay tuned.

And looked Onto upon the land, and saw that it was good:
- CSVs parsed good, the devilish comma betwixt data divined right
- UTFs looketh right
- tarql worketh fastly and loseth nearly nought data (0.08%)
- 760 million ducats of RDF spilt forth
- Prefixes unified and registered as http://prefix.cc/leak
- Ontology described by the [[https://www.w3.org/TR/void/][VOID]], and shalt be registered in the [[http://lov.okfn.org/][LOV]] (see [[https://plus.google.com/115593825497938381443/posts/7SaKJW3sanm][LOV announcement]])
- Data model lucid and clear
- Countries and Offshores hast connexion to DBpedia
Go forth and queriest! Whence did money came from, and whither did it flow?

And there was evening (actually well past midnight), and there was morning--the first day.

* Inferencing
Day 2: <2016-05-13 Fri>
What shalt we do today? How about inferring some new data from the basic RDF.
